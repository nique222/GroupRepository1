            People have been doing weird things with eggs since the dawn of eggs. One of the best of those weird things is Quiche. Quiche is fluffy eggs in a flaky crust. You can add in whatever you want, but in this recipe we're going to add cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions.

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Par-bake your crust at 375°F for 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook the bacon in a pan over medium until just crispy. Chop roughly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scoop out some (but not all) of the bacon fat with a spoon and throw the sliced onions into the pan. Stir occasionally over medium heat until the onions are deeply browned and cooked way down.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a bowl, beat together 4 eggs, whole milk, heavy cream, salt, and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whisk cheese, bacon, and onions into egg mixture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour the egg mixture into the pie crust.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook at 350°F for 45-55 minutes or until the center is just about set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Allow to cool for 15 minutes and serve!
                    </li>
